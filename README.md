# CloudSync Plugin for Obsidian

CloudSync is an Obsidian plugin that leverages cloud object storage to maintain a synchronized copy of your vault in the cloud. By connecting to Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage, the plugin enables three key capabilities: maintaining an always-current backup of your notes, seamlessly synchronizing your vault across multiple devices, and providing secure remote access to your notes when needed. Whether you're switching between devices, safeguarding your knowledge base, or accessing notes on the go, CloudSync handles the complexity of cloud synchronization while maintaining the security and integrity of your data.

**Important:** Implementation requires cloud provider account configuration and secure credential management. The complexity of setup varies by provider, all of them follow the same logic:
- create storage account or bucket
- set CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow Obsidian to interact with cloud storage
- create service account with minimal permissions (AWS and GCP only)
- generate/capture access keys required to interact with cloud storage.

Each of three cloud providers has slightly different logic and approach:

- Azure Storage offers the most straightforward setup through its web console: [Azure Cloud Storage setup](doc/azure.md)
- AWS S3 requires intermediate configuration, including manual creation of a JSON access policy: [AWS S3 bucket Setup](doc/aws.md)
- GCP Cloud Storage has the most complex setup, requiring execution of commands in Google Cloud Shell: [GCP storage bucket Setup](doc/gcp.md)

While the setup instructions are detailed and systematic, users without prior experience with cloud platforms should expect some learning curve, particularly for AWS and GCP implementations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Connect to leading three cloud providers:
  - Azure Blob Storage
  - AWS S3
  - Google Cloud Storage
- **Multi-Vault support**: Synchronizes multiple Obsidian vaults into a single storage bucket/account
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Synchronize Obsidian vaults between devices
- **Direct Cloud Connection**: No intermediate servers - data flows directly from Obsidian to cloud storage
- **Secure Transfer**: Uses transport encryption (TLS) and cloud provider's encryption at rest
- **Least privilege access**: Access credentials have lowest possible access rights to minimize the impact if credentials are compromised

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Are my Obsidian files encrypted when synchronized?**
A: The plugin uses transport encryption (TLS) and relies on cloud provider encryption at rest. Plugin is not encrypting files in local Obsidian Vault.

**Q: Where are my credentials stored?**
A: Credentials are stored locally in `data.json` in plugin directory of each Vault that has plugin installed.

**Q: Are my cloud credentials encrypted?**
A: Credentials in `data.json` are not encrypted, so user can find them and copy across different vaults. If bad actors got access to `data.json`, they got access to all other files in Obsidian vault - and on the whole device.

**Q: What are the worst case scenarios?**
A: Leaked/exposed cloud credentials have no permissions beyond read/write/delete rights to assigned storage account. The worst case scenarios:
- bad actor could delete all files from the storage account
- bad actor bloats the storage account with excessive data and causes financial damage
- bad actor could use exposed credentials to get access to synchronized files in storage account

**Q: Can the plugin developers access my data?**
A: No. The plugin connects directly to cloud storage. No data passes through third-party servers.
